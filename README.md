Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

This repository hosts the R code and documentation files for the Data Science's track course "Getting and Cleaning data", available in coursera.

The dataset being used is located at https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Files

The code assumes all the data is present in the same folder, un-compressed and without names altered.

CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

run_analysis.R contains all the code to perform the analysis described in 5 steps which can be launched in RStudio by importing the file.

The output of the 5th step is called averages_data.txt, and uploaded in the course project's form.
